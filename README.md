# Todo App - README

This is a basic Todo App built with React for the frontend and C# (.NET Core) for the backend. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and run the project locally.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

1. **Node.js** (latest stable version recommended)
2. **.NET SDK** (version 6.0 or later)
3. **SQL Server** (if the project uses a database)
4. **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)

---

## **Installation**

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Set Up the Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up the Backend

Navigate to the `backend` folder and restore the .NET dependencies:

```bash
cd ../backend
dotnet restore
```

If a database is required, update the `appsettings.json` file in the backend with your local SQL Server connection string.

---

## **Running the Project Locally**

### 1. Run the Backend

Navigate to the `backend` folder and start the server:

```bash
cd backend
dotnet run
```

The backend will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` or `https://localhost:5001` (HTTPS).

### 2. Run the Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and start the React development server:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm start
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### 3. Access the Application

Once both the frontend and backend are running, open your browser and navigate to:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```
